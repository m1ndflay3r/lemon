packagelists, aurpackagelists, and servicelists go here. You may use as many lists as you want, so long as their name begins with packagelist / aurpackagelist / servicelist (eg: packagelist1, packagelist2, etc).

packagelists can be generated via the following command: "pacman -Qqe | cut -d " " -f1 > /path/to/packagelist" (without quotes).

aurpackagelists should be created manually, as the names used by the installer are based on a packages git repository name.

servicelists must be created manually as far as I know. To make a servicelist, just list every service you wish enabled on its own line.

eg:
    ssh
    lightdm
    openntpd
    bluetooth
    NetworkManager
    apache2
